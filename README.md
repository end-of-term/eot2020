# End of Term Web Archive

This is the public repository for the End of Term Web Archive project. The End of Term Web Archive is a collaborative initiative that collects, preserves, and makes accessible United States Government websites at the end of presidential administrations. Beginning in 2008, the End of Term Web Archive has thus far preserved websites from administration changes in 2008, 2012, 2016 and is currently working to archive content from the 2020 electoral season. 

For the End of Term 2020 web archive, the Library of Congress, the Internet Archive, University of North Texas Libraries, Stanford University Libraries, the U.S. Government Publishing Office, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) have joined together to preserve public United States Government websites at the end of the current presidential administration ending January 20, 2021. Partners are joining together to select, collect, preserve, and make the web archives available for public access and research use. This archive is intended to document and preserve the federal government's presence on the web during the presidential transition and to expand and enhance the existing collections of the partner institutions.

## Collecting Scope
The End of Term Web Archive contains federal government websites (.gov, .mil, government websites not on the .gov domain, government social media accounts, public-nominated government sites, etc.) in the Legislative, Executive, or Judicial branches of the government. Local or state government websites or any other sites not part of the federal government domain are considered out of scope; however, some websites exist in a liminal space that makes "official" federal status hard to determine. The website seed lists published in this repository represent the full extent of the sites selected for archiving.

The project also solicits public nominations of websites to include in the archive. The online nomination tool for 2020 can be found at [End of Term 2020 Nomination Tool](https://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2020/about/). 

## Project Scope
The project has two phases: A broad, comprehensive baseline crawl of identified websites and more selective, focused crawls based on priorities established by the partners.

**Comprehensive Crawl** - The Internet Archive will undertake a comprehensive crawl of the URLs identified for this project beginning in October 2020 and again in early 2021 after the inauguration.
**Prioritized Crawl** - The project team is calling upon government information specialists, including librarians, political and social science researchers, and academics to assist in the selection and prioritization of the selected web sites to be included in the collection, as well as identifying the frequency and depth of collecting. The schedule for crawling of the prioritized URLs will be distributed across the project eam and announced as the project gets underway.
